# Data Science Projects

There are 3 major projects in this folder I completed during my Data Science course

## Wine quality prediction

Using open source dataset, we wanted to predict wine quality based on its chemical components. Different logistic regression models were used for prediction. The folder contains the code file (Rmd) and the pdf report itself.

## Industry Project

This is a research project related to data privacy. Through university, I was able to work for KPMG for a month where they requested us to research the current situation of data privacy.

The research project aim was to identify groups of people who especially need education on data privacy based on characteristics such as demographic, socio-economic or cultural background.

For more information, read the report.

## Hypertension

This data science project seeked to better understand the correlation between hypertension and different habits as well as biomarkers. By implementing different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest or Logistic Regression, on the ABS health data, we observed how well biomarkers can predict hypertension.

The folder contains the final report and the code file (Rmd).
